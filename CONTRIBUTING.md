1. Fork the repository.
2. Local development is broken into two parts:
   First run `npm start` from `/src` and then from `/example`.
   Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, create-react-app will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library)
3. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-awesome-feature).
4. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add/fix some feature').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin my-awesome-feature).
6. Create new Pull Request.
